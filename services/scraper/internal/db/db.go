// Package db writes the raw tables of a scrape run.
//
// These statements were first written by sqlc from a file of queries and the migrations. The
// generator is no longer part of the project, so the code is now kept by hand. A change to a raw
// table is made here as well as in a new migration in infra/postgres/migrations.
